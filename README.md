###  WHAT IT DOES:
Are You Happy? is an Android app that utilizes HPE's machine learning APIs to determine the level of happiness or sadness in its users.  It does so by asking the user a series of personal questions which reveal data about the user's self esteem and mood.  The user's speech response is transcribed into text using an API call, then the returned text is analyzed for sentiment.  The sentiment values for each question are then aggregated and categorized to determine an overall happy/sad percent.  The user is then prompted to take a selfie, which is overlayed with graphics and information pertaining to their emotional state.
